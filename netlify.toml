# Note: For long-running renders, consider:
# 1. Upgrading to Netlify Pro for 26s function timeout
# 2. Using Netlify Background Functions for up to 15 minutes
# 3. The current implementation returns synchronously which may timeout
#    for longer videos. If this happens, consider using a queue-based approach.
